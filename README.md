Admin section
The admin section (apart from the log in form) must only be accessible to logged in admin users and must include the following features.

Login/Logout
Create an admin login form that allows administrator users to login. Use local storage to keep the user logged in.

When logged in, display a logout button in the layout that logs the user out. Logging out should not clear the cart.

Add/edit products
Create form(s) that allow products to be added and edited. The form must allow the user to toggle whether a product is featured.

Product images
For adding/editing product images use either of these 2 methods:

Use a file upload field to upload images to Strapi, or
Use a text input that allows a URL to be entered. This allows an image from an external URL to be used as the product image.
You can find the fields for each in Strapi. Use only one to display a product image.

Delete existing product
Allow products to be deleted. Before a product is deleted you must display a confirmation dialog. The product should only be deleted if the user confirms.
